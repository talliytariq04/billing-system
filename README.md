Project Introduction:  
• The project is on Super Market Billing System. Super 
market is the place where customers come to 
purchase their daily using products and pay for that. 
So, there is the need to calculate how many 
products are sold and generate the bill of customer.  
• Supermarket billing system deals with the 
automation of supermarket. This software will help 
salespersons in managing the various types of 
records.  
• It consumes the considerable time and energy that 
could be utilized in the better productive activities. 
Apart from that, with increasing customer strength, 
the task of managing information of each individual 
customer is indeed a cumbersome task.  
• “Super Market Billing System” aims at developing 
into software that can be used at places like 
shopping malls,  
Super markets to easily maneuver the daily tasks of 
taking the order, calculating the bill etc.   
• This Super Market Billing System is a simple console 
application built in C++ without the use of Graphics. 
This project will help you understand basically two 
things – use of stream class and file handling in C++ 
programming language.  
• In the manual system, there are number of 
inefficiencies that a salesperson face. The 
information retrieval is one of the foremost 
problems. It is very difficult to gather the overall 
performance reports of the customer. Large 
records-books have to be maintained where 
relevant and irrelevant information has to be 
stored.  
• The automation deals with all such problems and 
tries to remove them in the best suitable fashion. 
The new system will cater to the need of the sales 
persons of any supermarket so that salesperson can 
manage the system efficiently. Supermarket billing 
system is developed with the objective of making 
the system reliable, easier, fast, and more 
informative.  
2) Scope of Project:  
• Scope of this project is to investigate and design a 
software solution which can facilitate both 
customer and salesperson in performing their daily 
tasks, improving efficiency, and helping them to be 
more productive.   
• This project will provide a solution through which 
salesperson can easily manage, handle and generate 
all required information in their respective format 
when needed. It provides quick way of operation by 
capturing the manual process and automating them. 
It will help them to manage the bill details, 
financial data, and historical data and also in 
producing documents of different formats for 
different customers.  
• This solution will help salesperson in reducing effort 
spend on managing many bills. It will also provide 
them opportunity to explore possibility of 
generating documents, managing financial details.   
• This system will help the salesperson to manage in 
fast billing. It will help to maintain the data of the 
purchased items. It also gives bill to the customers. 
It will set the rates of taxes and commission on 
products. The project will enable to see the report 
regarding product and category in a fixed period of 
time. It can also change the Graphical User 
interface of the system.  
• It also speeds up various processes such as addition of 
new items to the menu, deletion of items from the menu, 
modification of details of items and calculation of bills 
thus providing convenience to the workers as well as 
customers.  
3) Advantages of Proposed System:   
Converts all the manual work which is time consuming 
and error prone to fully automated system   
• Helps in eliminating all the paper work, saves time and 
improves customer services.   
• Makes the addition of items in the menu, deletion of 
items and modification of items in the menu easier and 
faster.   
• C++ has support for most of the web servers available 
today .  
• Bills can be calculated more easily and with more 
accuracy   
• Reduces pressure on the labor.   
• Makes the system more feasible and flexible and thus 
retrieval of information becomes convenient.    
4) Objectives of Proposed System:  
To reduce time for the organization.  
• To increase efficiency and accuracy of the system.  
• To reduce pressure on the labour and relieving man power          
from repetitive and dull job.   
• To make the retrieval of information faster.  
• To make the system more feasible.   
• To reduce large amount of paper work.  
• To make the system more reliable to avoid any ambiguity.   
• To reduce the cost factor of the system   
• To make the system more flexible.  
5) Team & Responsibilities:  
• This report is collectively made by Arshia Asif and Talliya 
Tariq   having Enrollment numbers (01-135241-009) and (01
135241-049) respectively.  
• Also, the data of report was collected collectively.   
6) Functional Requirements of Project:  
• This system will ask the user for username and 
password and after that user will be given choice 
to select from new record, see old record and 
delete record.  
• After the user enters the option for new record 
the console asks for name of data, quantity and 
price unit/kg. And by selecting the old record the 
last record is shown. If delete record is selected 
so the last saved record is deleted.  
7) Functioning of Project:  
Login System:  
• We used structures for the login in system. Firstly, the system will 
ask for username and then password.  
• If we put correct username and password, it will move up to main 
menu screen.  
• If we put incorrect username or password, it will say that your 
username or password is incorrect and will ask to continue login 
system by pressing ‘y’ or will ask to close the program by pressing  
‘n’.
